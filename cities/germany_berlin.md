# Berlin
**Notes:**

- Most clubs are open between midnight and noon. People start arriving at 2AM and peak is from 3AM to 7AM
- Due to the long hours, some clubs will serve food and caffeinated beverages (e.g. pizza, fries, currywurst, coffee, tea, mate)
- Some clubs will state "No photos allowed" and place stickers over your phone's cameras
- Clubs/bars might take a deposit on drinks (e.g. 0.50€). You might receive a token with your glass which you return with your glass to get the deposit back
- In clubs, people seem to wear black, white, and dull colors
