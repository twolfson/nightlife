# New York City
**These notes are tentative (i.e. informed from a low sample set), use them with caution**

**Notes:**

- Outbound public transit is fine but subways at 4AM feel slow/infrequent, consider using a taxi instead
- Official last call is 4AM but there seem to be plenty of after-hours on Resident Advisor
