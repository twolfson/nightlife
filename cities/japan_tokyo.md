# Tokyo, Japan
**Premature notes:**

- I have not yet seen a place close (latest I was out was at 3:30AM)
- Most club staff seems to know English (unlike most store clerks)
- Crowd is big at midnight but swells and peaks from 2AM to 3AM
- Some clubs can be concert-like, others can be dance club like. Still haven't figured this one out yet
