# Tokyo, Japan
**Recommendations:**

- For drinking, [Hub 2](#hub-2) has good prices, a decent crowd, and a nice mix of foreigners/locals
- For dancing on weekdays, [Womb](#womb) is the best choice with good music and a nice crowd
- For dancing on the weekend, I never found an option I liked. It is either too crowded or a one-time event far away. Good luck =)
