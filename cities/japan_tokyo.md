# Tokyo, Japan
**Premature notes:**

- I have not yet seen a place close (latest I was out was at 3:30AM)
- Most club staff seems to know English (unlike most store clerks)
- Crowd is big at midnight but swells and peaks from 2AM to 3AM
- Some clubs can be concert-like, others can be dance club like. Still haven't figured this one out yet
- There is surprisingly little to no grinding (except for a few non-Japanese)

## clubasia (Club Asia)
- 1 large dancefloor that was like a concert venue (crowd followed DJs actions)
- 1 lounge area with ambient music and bar
- 1 small dancefloor
- Lockers in lounge area for storing belongings
- Went for "Weekend Ravers" event, saw a few kandi but mostly t-shirts and button-downs
- 3500 yen cover ($35)
- 500 yen ($5) for a bottle of water x_x
