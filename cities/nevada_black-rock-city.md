# Black Rock City aka Burning Man
**Notes:**

We cannot say much about this since everything changes each year.

During the day, the city is docile. Most people day drink, gather supplies, and attend workshops. It is very hot and unless you have good shade, you will not be able to sleep past 10.

At night, the city transforms into a rave wonderland. There are glowing mutant vehicles that drive around shooting fire and playing beats. There are talented dancers that will mesmorize you with their movements. There are massive stages with amazing DJs. And it goes on for hours, and repeats every night.

While you are in the US, the culture is very different. There are colloquialisms like "Welcome Home" and "Have a good burn". When the sun goes down, everyone howls.

Very useful things to have:

- Bike
- Watch (if you want to attend workshops/events)
- Empty cup (people have drinks that they serve but you need a cup)
- Shade

The greatest spectacle is the night when the man burns. As he burns, it kicks up ash and dust, and outputs a huge amount of heat. Fire tornadoes spin off of his massive flame. After that, it is a party until sunrise with glowing warm on the playa from the man.
