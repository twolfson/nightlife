# Tokyo, Japan
**Premature notes:**

- I have not yet seen a place close (latest I was out was at 4:30AM)
- Depending on the club staff, they will know or not know English
    - I have done my best to document expectations
- Crowd is big at midnight but swells and peaks from 2AM to 3AM
- There is surprisingly little grinding. Although, there is public displays of affection which is rare in normal daytime
- Most clubs have lockers for storing belongings

## clubasia (Club Asia)
