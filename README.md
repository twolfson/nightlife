## Notes
In our notes, we try to answer the following questions. We skip over music since that can vary significantly from night to night.

- Is it a bar, club, combination, or something else?
- How many rooms are there? What is in each room (e.g. bar, tables, dancefloor)? How big are they? What kind of visual effects did they have?
- When did you go? (day of the week, date/season)
    - How crowded does it get? Can we still dance?
    - What was the cover?
        - Is reentry allowed?
    - In foreign countries, how many locals were there? How many foreigners?
    - Was there a dress code?
- What is the cost of a drink?
- How much was coat check?
- In foreign countries, how much English did the staff speak?
