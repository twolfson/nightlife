# Puerto Vallarta, Mexico
**Notes:**

- Smoking in bars/clubs is normal acceptable behavior.
- People in night clubs (discotechs is the local term) will salsa dance next to normal club dancing. Depending on the song, the ratio might favor one over the other.
- Some places close as late as 6AM (virtually no last call)
- 12AM or 1AM is a good time to head out
