# Notes for Japan

- Depending on the club staff, they will know or not know English
    - I have done my best to document expectations
- Crowd is big at midnight but swells and peaks from 2AM to 3AM
- Unless stated otherwise, last call is usually at 5AM
- There is little grinding. Although, there is public displays of affection which is rare in normal daytime
- Most clubs have lockers for storing belongings
- Water is usually not free and in small bottles
    - I suggest buying it once and refilling in bathroom
